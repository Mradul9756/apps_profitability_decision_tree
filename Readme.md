## Part 1 & 2 Python and R CART modeling on a data set of your choice

Pick a data set you are interested in. (It can be from the book or online)
Complete the following analysis in both Python and in R. Save your .py and .r in this folder and submit to whitgit. 

1. In the following space provided, describe the data set and why it interests you, also describe where you found this data set.

    ```
        Describe your data here:

    ```
2. Partition the data set into training and test.
2. Do a CART analysis using the training data set for a particular target variable.
3. Look at the graph, and see if the decision nodes make sense. Describe your thoughts about the decision nodes below:

    ```
        Describe your data here:

    ```

4. Run a prediction on the test data.
5. Describe the results. How well did your model do? Write your answer below.
  
    ```
        Were the predicted target variables accurate? What was the percentage of missed predictions?

    ```
